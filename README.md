3rd Prototype Flex Sensor Keyboard


The Mobile Interaction Glove was developed as part of a studio looking at how we interact with mobile phones. I wanted to develop a method of using a phone that didn't require speaking or taking your attention away from your surroundings. I developed an Arduino based glove prototype that used 3 homemade flex sensors to deduce inputs based on the bending of the first three fingers on your hand, and translate them to keyboard characters to send to the phone via bluetooth, the device also had three vibration motors to provide individual haptic feedback per finger.
